Notes Webapp
============

This project is for testing the browser's application cache and browser storage. It stores the needed files offline
with the *.appcache in the browser's application cache. The application stores the data in the browser storage
for offline usage.

This application is optimized for iOS Webapps. Just use the Safari feature "add to homescreen" to get the fully webapp
features.

Build
-----

There is a Gruntfile.js for building the webapp with grunt so you need [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Just run on CLI:

	npm install
	grunt
